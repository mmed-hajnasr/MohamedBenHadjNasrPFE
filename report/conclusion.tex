The document outlines a comprehensive plan to transition from a slow and error-prone deployment process to a significantly faster and more reliable one. This is achieved by embracing a DevOps approach that leverages cloud computing, automation, and modern tools and methodologies. The new approach will automate the entire deployment lifecycle, incorporate security best practices, and utilize Scrum for structured project management.
Following this plan, the initial steps have been successfully completed. This includes provisioning the cloud infrastructure with Terraform modules and establishing a CI/CD pipeline that utilizes GitLab Flow for branching.  These initial steps lay the foundation for future sprints to focus on building and deploying the web application within the cloud environment.
The document concludes by outlining the chosen deployment strategy (blue-green deployment) and the implemented rollback strategy to ensure smooth recovery in case of any issues. Additionally, a monitoring strategy has been established to monitor the health, performance, and usage of the deployed web application. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, the project aims to achieve faster, more reliable deployments with minimal downtime and improved rollback capabilities.
